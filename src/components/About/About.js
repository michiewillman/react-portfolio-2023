        <p>
          Climbing my way up to a senior-level design position from a degree in
          communications wasn't easy, but I was determined to make it work. I am
          excited to prove my passion and ambition for web development in the
          same way. Utilizing my advanced skills acquired from the Full Stack
          Web Development bootcamp from the University of Oregon, I'm ready to
          create applications that will serve my community in a positive way.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm technically skilled in the following languages and technologies:
          Node.js, Express.js, React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Graph QL, MySQL,
          NoSQL, MongoDB, REST APIs, third-party APIs, Handlebars, Bootstrap,
          Tailwind, and more.
